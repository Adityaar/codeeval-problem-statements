<h2>Repeated Substring</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>

<p>
    You are to find the longest repeated substring in a given text. Repeated substrings may not overlap.
    If more than one substring is repeated with the same length, print the first one you find.(starting from the
    beginning of the text).
<br>
    NOTE: The substrings can&apos;t be all spaces.
</p>

<h3>Input sample:</h3>
<p>
    Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename.
    The input file contains several lines. Each line is one test case. Each line contains a test string. E.g.
</p>
<pre>banana
am so uniqe</pre>

<h3>Output sample:</h3>

<p>
    For each set of input produce a single line of output which is the longest repeated substring.
    If there is none, print out the string NONE. E.g.
</p>
<pre>an
NONE</pre>
