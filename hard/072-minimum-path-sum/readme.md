<h2>Minimum Path Sum</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>
<p>
    You are given an n*n matrix of integers. You can move only right and down.
    Calculate the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right
</p>

<h3>Input sample:</h3>
<p>
    Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename.
    The first line will have the value of n(the size of the square matrix).
    This will be followed by n rows of the matrix.
    (Integers in these rows will be comma delimited). After the n rows, the pattern repeats. E.g.
</p>
<pre>2
4,6
2,8
3
1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9</pre>

<h3>Output sample:</h3>

<p>
    Print out the minimum path sum for each matrix. E.g.
</p>

<pre>14
21</pre>
