<h2>Longest Common Subsequence</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>
<p>
    You are given two sequences. Write a program to determine the longest
    common subsequence between the two strings (each string can have
    a maximum length of 50 characters).
    NOTE: This subsequence need not be contiguous.
    The input file may contain empty lines,
    these need to be ignored.
</p>

<h3>Input sample:</h3>
<p>
    The first argument will be a path to a filename that contains two strings per line,
    semicolon delimited. You can assume that there is only
    one unique subsequence per test case. E.g.
</p>
<pre>XMJYAUZ;MZJAWXU</pre>

<h3>Output sample:</h3>

<p>
    The longest common subsequence. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces on each line you print. E.g.
</p>
<pre>MJAU</pre>
