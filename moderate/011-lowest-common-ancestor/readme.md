<h2>Lowest Common Ancestor</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>

<p>
    Write a program to determine the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary search tree. You may hardcode the
    following binary search tree in your program:
</p>
<pre>    30
    |
  ____
  |   |
  8   52
  |
____
|   |
3  20
    |
   ____
  |   |
  10 29</pre>

<h3>Input sample:</h3>
<p>
    The first argument is a path to a file that contains two values. These values represent two nodes within the tree,
    one per line. E.g.:
</p>
<pre>8 52
3 29</pre>

<h3>Output sample:</h3>

<p>
    Print to stdout the lowest common ancestor, one per line. Lowest means the lowest depth in the tree,
    not the lowest value. E.g.:
</p>
<pre>30
8</pre>
