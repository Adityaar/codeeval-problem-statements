<h2>Alternative reality</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>

<p>
    Have you even wondered about another life? Maybe there is an alternative reality where different things are
    happening. Everything is almost the same, but still a bit different&#x2026; <br>
    You are walking in one reality, but driving the car in another. Here you like golf, and there &#x2013; basketball.
    In one reality you changed a $100 banknote to five $20 banknotes, while in another &#x2013; to ten $10 banknotes. <br>
    Today, your task is to count how many alternative versions of money change are if you have 1&#xA2;, 5&#xA2;, 10&#xA2;, 25&#xA2;,
    and 50&#xA2; coins. <br>
    So, if you have 11 cents that you need to change, you have four alternative ways how to do it:
</p>

<h3>Input sample:</h3>
