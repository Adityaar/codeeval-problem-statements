<h2>Reverse Groups</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>

<p>
    Given a list of numbers and a positive integer k, reverse the elements of
    the list, k items at a time. If the number of elements is not a multiple
    of k, then the remaining items in the end should be left as is.

    separated by a semicolon. The list of numbers are comma delimited. E.g.
</p>
<pre>1,2,3,4,5;2
1,2,3,4,5;3</pre>

<h3>Output sample:</h3>

<p>
    Print out the new comma separated list of numbers obtained after reversing.
