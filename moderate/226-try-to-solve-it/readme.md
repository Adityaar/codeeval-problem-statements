<h2>Try to solve it</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>

<p>
    The history of cryptography has about four thousand years. It dates back to the days of the Ancient Rome and
    continues up till our times. Over the years, a countless number of methods and encryption algorithms have
    emerged. However, as hackers say, there is nothing impossible to hack or decipher. Try your hand at decoding
    the code below and see how quickly you will get it right!<br>
    So, you have to determine the encryption algorithm of the message below and print the decoded word. If you find
    the task too difficult, get a hint at the bottom of the page.
</p>

<h3>Input sample:</h3>

<p>
    The first argument is a path to a file. Each row includes a test case with an encoded word.
</p>
