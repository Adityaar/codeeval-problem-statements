<h2>Flavius Josephus</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>

<p>
    Flavius Josephus was a famous Jewish historian of the first century,
    at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple. According to legend,
    during the Jewish-Roman war he was trapped in a cave with a group of
    soldiers surrounded by Romans. Preferring death to capture, the Jews
    decided to form a circle and, proceeding around it, to kill every
    j&apos;th person remaining until no one was left. Josephus found the safe
    spot in the circle and thus stayed alive.
