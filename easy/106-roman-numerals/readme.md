<h2>Roman Numerals</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>

<p>
    Many persons are familiar with the Roman numerals for relatively small
    numbers. The symbols <b>I</b> (capital i), <b>V</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, and <b>M</b> represent the decimal values
    1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 respectively. To represent other values,
    these symbols, and multiples where necessary, are concatenated, with the
    smaller-valued symbols written further to the right. For example,
    the number 3 is represented as <b>III</b>, and the value 73 is represented
    as <b>LXXIII</b>. The exceptions to this rule occur for numbers having units
    values of 4 or 9, and for tens values of 40 or 90. For these cases, the
    Roman numeral representations are <b>IV</b> (4), <b>IX</b> (9), <b>XL</b> (40), and <b>XC</b> (90).
    So the Roman numeral representations for 24, 39, 44, 49, and 94 are
<b>XXIV</b>, <b>XXXIX</b>, <b>XLIV</b>, <b>XLIX</b>, and <b>XCIV</b>,
    respectively.
