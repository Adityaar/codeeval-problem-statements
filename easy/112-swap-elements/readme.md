<h2>Swap Elements</h2>

<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>

<p>
    You are given a list of numbers which is supplemented with positions
    that have to be swapped.
</p>

<h3>Input sample:</h3>
<p>
    Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Input example is the following
</p>
<pre>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : 0-8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 : 0-1, 1-3</pre>
<p>
    As you can see a colon separates numbers with positions.
<br>
    Positions start with 0.
<br>
    You have to process positions left to right.
    In the example above (2nd line) first you process 0-1, then 1-3.
</p>

<h3>Output sample:</h3>

<p>
    Print the lists in the following way.
</p>

<pre>9 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1
2 4 3 1 5 6 7 8 9 10</pre>
